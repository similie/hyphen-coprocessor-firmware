# Similie Coprocessor Firmware
This respository supports our SDI controller board. Additionally, it supports logic for storing serial data to a local SD card for offline opperation. Since our primary logic board does not support the SDI interface, we use an Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger as a SAMD/32u4 co-processor. If offloads some of the processing from the primary controller and expands our ability to connect different sensors to our Hyphen network.
#### This board supports the [Arduino SDI-12](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12) library. Though other pins may function for the SDI-12 interface, we have tested the functionality on pins 10, 11, and 13. We use these microprocessors to support our SDI-12 rang of environmental sensors.
